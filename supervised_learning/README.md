## Linear Regression

Linear Regression was developed under the field of statistics to study the relationship between input and output numerical variables but has been borrowed by machine learning to make predictions based on a linear regression equation.

## Logistic Regression

Linear regression is used to predict values of quantities as a linear function of the input values. When predicting a discrete variable, such as whether a grid of pixel intensities represents 0 or 1, we need to classify the input values. Logistic regression is a simple classification algorithm for learning to make such decisions. It is a model that is used when the dependent variable is categorical.
